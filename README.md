# rcv-webapp

A webapplication for running RCV simulations and visualizing the results.

Since its launch in 2021, this web app has been subsumed by MGGG's [VoteKit](https://github.com/mggg/votekit) Python package. We no longer maintain this app and are no longer able to verify the validity of the results it produces. If you are interested in being part of an effort to relaunch this app, please contact us at code@mggg.org and we'd love to chat!

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Before getting started

Ensure that you are running this application with node version `~v15.13.0`.

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
This build is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch on this repository, triggering a build of the application via GitHub Pages.
