# rcv-webapp

A webapplication for running RCV simulations and visualizing the results.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Before getting started

Ensure that you are running this application with node version `~v15.13.0`.

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
This build is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch on this repository, triggering a build of the application via GitHub Pages.
